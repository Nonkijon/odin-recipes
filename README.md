I'm about to start my first HTML project on The Odin Project.
My goal is to become a programmer. HTML is only a mark-up language,
however it is the first step on this journey. I've already learned about 
the roadmap, how to use Ubuntu, CLI, set-up a virtual machine and use Git
and Github. One thing to bear in mind is to commit often. My QA experience
should be valuable on this front. And it's important to keep good practices on
this journey.# odin-recipes
